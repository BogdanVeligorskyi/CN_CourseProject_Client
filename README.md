# CN_CourseProject_Client
Client part of course project from CN (Комп'ютерні мережі)

In the process of development Qt Creator and C++ were used. This part, unlike Server, has graphical interface.

Purpose of client part is providing ways for convenient chatting with other users inside local network (for example, company network). 
Also client is responsible for registering new users, allowing existing users to log into system.
As a feature, "Chat" has chatbot: click on it in the main screen and you can easily find all users according to chosen role.

NOTE: client doesn`t work until you connect to server (this project is in repository CN_CourseProject_Server).

In order to run this application you have to start EXE-file after executing server. If you need EXE-file - contact me.
